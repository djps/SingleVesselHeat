### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports 

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report


#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on OSX and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that the program crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On OSX, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance**, include a [CPU profile capture and a screenshot](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-performance-problems-with-the-dev-tools-cpu-profiler) with your report.
* **If the Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it**, that normally means that an exception was thrown. The Console tab will include an entry for the exception. Expand the exception so that the stack trace is visible, and provide the full exception and stack trace in a [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) and as a screenshot.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance-problems-with-the-dev-tools-cpu-profiler)?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from [the releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of gcc are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `gcc -v` in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running code in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-enhancement-suggestions) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)** for tips — you might discover that the enhancement is already available. 
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on OSX and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of gcc you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `gcc -v` in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette).
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.


### Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [CoffeeScript](#coffeescript-styleguide),
  [JavaScript](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript),
  and [CSS](https://github.com/styleguide/css) styleguides.
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured
  [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder. Run them using `apm test`. See the [Specs Styleguide](#specs-styleguide) below.
* Document new code based on the
  [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)
    * Instance methods and properties
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
    * Use `require('fs-plus').getHomeDirectory()` to get the home directory.
    * Use `path.join()` to concatenate filenames.
    * Use `os.tmpdir()` rather than `/tmp` when you need to reference the
      temporary directory.
* Using a plain `return` when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
    * Not `return null`, `return undefined`, `null`, or `undefined`

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`

#### Example

```coffee
# Public: Disable the package with the given name.
#
# * `name`    The {String} name of the package to disable.
# * `options` (optional) The {Object} with disable options (default: {}):
#   * `trackTime`     A {Boolean}, `true` to track the amount of time taken.
#   * `ignoreErrors`  A {Boolean}, `true` to catch and ignore errors thrown.
# * `callback` The {Function} to call after the package has been disabled.
#
# Returns `undefined`.
disablePackage: (name, options, callback) ->
```

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. 

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

#### Type of Issue and Issue State

| Label name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests. |
| `bug` |  Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs. |
| `question` | Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X). |
| `feedback` | General feedback more than bug reports or feature requests. |
| `help-wanted` | Help wanted in resolving these issues. |
| `beginner` | Less complex issues which would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute. |
| `more-information-needed` | More information needs to be collected about these problems or feature requests (e.g. steps to reproduce). |
| `needs-reproduction` | Likely bugs, but haven't been reliably reproduced. |
| `duplicate` |  Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before. |
| `wontfix` | Admin has decided not to fix these issues for now, either because they're working as intended or for some other reason. |
| `invalid` |  Issues which aren't valid (e.g. user errors). |
