/**
  \class   Array3D
  \brief   An implementation of a 3-d array.
  \details The idea is that if we solve the heat equation in a ADI FD method, we get tridiagonal matrices. However, if we force the 3-d array into a 1-d array, then we no longer have true tridiagonal matrices because everything gets mixed up. SO: we need to implement fancy tridiag multiplication schemes and solvers that know about this internal trouble. Should be relatively easy, although a pain to parallelize.
  \note The array will be stored as a long array in the order \f$ T_{0,0,0}, T_{0,0,1}, T_{0,0,2} \ldots T_{0,0,n_{z-1}}, T_{0,1,0} \ldots \f$

At each step, check whether the central point is larger than all the others. An alternative is to have a moving set of nearest neighbours (in 3-d, this would be a set of 6 points plus one central point). However, this has obvious difficulties since it is easy to think of a function that is diagonal to the Cartesian grid and would present false local maxima. So rather go with a full grid of 27 unless it proves to be absurdly slow.
     * I'm not sure how to check the borders efficiently. So I think it's easiest if I simply assume that the borders definitely do not contain local maxima. We can ensure this by editing the array when it is loaded, but that's not the problem of this routine.

     * Perhaps not too straightforward, though. Basically, it is a _binary insert_ where the range of possible positions is halved each time. Insertion will always occur at the left of the range, so we must ensure that anything to the left (or rather, with lower index) than the left of the range is definitely larger than the value we are inserting. The right-hand side of the range is moved to ensure that the iterations end, but is otherwise not really involved.
     * Note that equality implies insertion, i.e. things are replaced by a new element of equal value. This is simply easier to code. It is easily changed by adding a quick check at the end, but that will slow things down.

    * \details Again, a, b, c are the sub, main and superdiagonals, Index is 1, 2 or 3 and N is the appropriate number of elements.
    * Depending on index, we are either solving \f$ M_{ij} x_{klj} = d_{kli}\f$, \f$ M_{ij} x_{kjl} = d_{kil}\f$ or \f$ M_{ij} x_{jkl} = d_{ikl}\f$. At the call of this function, array contains the right-hand-side \f$ d\f$ . After the call, the member array contains the solution \f$ x\f$ .
    * Some of the input vectors are overwritten. Sorry about this.
    * Basically, we copy the desired right-hand-side vector into a work vector, then call the traditional tridiagonal solver. Bit of a clunky method, but it's almost certainly faster than anything else I can think of. Note that we need two work vectors, since the tridiagonal routine doesn't copy solution over the right-hand-side vector.
    * Also note that we feed in two other indices. These are the values of the indices that do not take part in the matrix equation.
    * \note THIS ROUTINE ONLY SOLVES THE MATRIX EQUATION FOR A SINGLE SET OF THESE OTHER INDICES. IT DOES NOT SOLVE IT FOR ALL INDICES AND IT WIPES OUT THE VALUES OF THE INPUT VECTORS. The reason for this is that the inhomogeneous heat equation does not break up nicely into independent 1-d problems. If it did, then each matrix inversion would be independent of the uninvolved indices. But it doesn't and the matrix inversion depends on these indices.
